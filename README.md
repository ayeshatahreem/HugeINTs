# HugeINTs
Program that takes as input 2-HUGE-INTEGER N1 and N2. User may enter any number of digits he wants to (N is not taken in an array of huge size, hence very careful about the size). 

N3 addHugeINTs(N1, N2) // appropriate data-types for Ns

N3 mulHugeINTs(N1, N2) // appropriate data-types for Ns
